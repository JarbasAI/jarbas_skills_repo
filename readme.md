## Jarbas Skills Repo

This is my personal skills repository, this is used by JarbasSkillsManager to install new skills

It is basically a personal version of the [official mycroft skills repo](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills)

This is aimed at [jarbas-core](https://github.com/JarbasAl/jarbas-core), but should work just fine in mycroft

## Skills

* core - core skills in every platform
* common - common skills to every platform
* desktop - skills that require desktop platform (assumed to be default platform)
* kde - skills that require kde
* mycroft_mark_1 - skills that require mycroft_mark1
* picroft - skills that require picroft
* jarbas - skills that require jarbas-core

## Adding a skill

create a pull request, add to/create "common.txt" file, alphabetical order please!

    my_skill_name , my_github_url
    
or if you don't provide the url, the official skills repo will be searched for my_skill_name and url extracted from there

    my_skill_name , 
    
if the skill requires a platform add it to "platform_name.txt" instead
